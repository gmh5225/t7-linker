# T7 Linker

100% accurate and complete Black Ops 2 FastFile linker I wrote ages ago.  
Instead of manually writing/generating serialization code, it hooks the game's FastFile loading code to make it generate a FastFile.

A lot of things are missing to get it to compile. This is only for archiving purposes.  
Requires the dedicated server binary.
